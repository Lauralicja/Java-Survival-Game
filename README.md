# Java-Survival-Game
Java project of a survival game, the same as 'Cpp Console Game'

This is a Java version of a 'Cpp Console Game' created for Gda≈Ñsk University of Technology.
However, this version has its own UI instead of console.

In this game, the protagonist has to survive for as much as he can. Each letter represents different animal/plant.

For every type of object, there are different passive abilities and statistics.

Antelope can jump for 2 spaces. Fox can 'smell' the enemy, thus running if he is closer than 2 spaces. Guarana can give the eater specific amount of strenght. Hogweed makes an area around poisonous. Belladonna poisons the eater. Turtle is immune to attacks under certain amount, but is much slower. Sow spreads itself faster than other plants.

Particular statistics are different for each animal and plant, however they can be changed anytime in code.

Program ends with the death of a protagonist.
